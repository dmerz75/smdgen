Methodologies: Steered Molecular Dynamics

A quick description of steered molecular dynamics:
 -obtaining the Potential of Mean Force(PMF) pulling a peptide
 -a 'pseudoatom' connected by a harmonic potential to a site on the peptide
    is directed along an axis or through configuration space at a constant
    velocity, during which time the force applied on the peptide by the 
    'pseudoatom' is recorded, thereby allowing one to calculate the work
    for a single trajectory and the PMF for multiple trajectories by 
    boltzmann weighting the work and taking the average of that result.

Preparations:
 1) place 00.pdb and 00.psf for any peptide, previously subjected to
    equilibration, in its own directory in 01.struc-equil.[amb,namd] folder
    >>> for a peptide pep, /01.struc-equil.namd/pep/01.vac/00.pdb,00.psf
    >>> for a peptide ba, /01.struc-equil.namd/ba/03.exp/00.pdb,00.psf
    if amber:
    >>> for a peptide da, ./01.struc-equil.amb/da/02.imp/00.prmtop,00.inpcrd
 2) create solvent templates in 00.maindir.namd for a new peptide
    >>> /0000-maindir/pep/02.imp/smd.namd
 3) make necessary modifications to gen.py
 4) './gen.py' creates the working directories
 5) upload the directory onto a cluster
 6) SMD:  './run.py' submits all job.sh scripts to the PBS resource manager
